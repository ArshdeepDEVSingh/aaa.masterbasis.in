<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>A rational number is a number that is expressed as the ratio of two integers, where the denominator should not be equal to zero</p>

<p style="background-color:Gray;">#Rational numbers are the number which are in fraction and most of the decimal numbers can also be called rational numbers</p>

<h3>Additon</h3>
<h5>Case-1<h5>
<ul>
  <li>Suppose we have an equation x/y + z/y</li>
  <li>Now denomenators of both terms are same.</li>
  <li>So we will add neumerators of both terms and take denomenator as common.</li>
  <li>Like this => x+z/y OR a/y {x+z=a}</li>
</ul>

<h5>Case-2<h5>
<ul>
  <li>Suppose we have an expression x/y + a/b</li>
  <li>Now denomenators of both terms are different</li>
  <li>So we will take L.C.M. of denomerators of both terms.</li>
  <p>{suppose L.C.M. of both denomenators(y and b) is m}</p>
  <li>Then we will do this 1. (m/y)*x = n</li>
  <li>                     2. (m/b)*a = o</li>
  <li>Then our answer will be n+o/m OR p/m {n+o=p}</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subtraction</h3>
<h5>Case-1<h5>
<ul>
  <li>Suppose we have an equation x/y - z/y</li>
  <li>Now denomenators of both terms are same.</li>
  <li>So we will subtract neumerators of first terms from neumerator of second term and take denomenator as common.</li>
  <li>Like this => x-z/y OR a/y {x-z=a}</li>
</ul>

<h5>Case-2<h5>
<ul>
  <li>Suppose we have an expression x/y - a/b</li>
  <li>Now denomenators of both terms are different</li>
  <li>So we will take L.C.M. of denomenators of both terms.</li>
  <p>{suppose L.C.M. of both denomenators(y and b) is m}</p>
  <li>Then we will do this 1. (m/y)*x = n</li>
  <li>                     2. (m/b)*a = o</li>
  <li>Then our answer will be n-o/m OR p/m {n-o=p}</li>
</ul>

<h5>Multiplication</h5>
<ul>
  <li>We can divide any neumerator by denomenator</li>
  <li>OR any denomenator by any neumerator.</li>
  <p>{These step told in upper two lines cannot be done with any number, if the number is in bracket or in multiply of any bracket.}</p>
  <li>If any neumerator and any denomenator are not divisible so, we will do a very simple operation taht we will multiply all the nemerator with each other and write them in neumerator place.</li>
  <li>And we will mutiply all the denomenators with each other and write them in denomenator place.</li>
  
  
<h5>Case-1</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Suppose we have an expression 2/5 * 10/8</li>
  <li>Now like we know 2&10 are in multiply and 5&8 are in divide of them,</li>
  <li>and also we know is that 8 can divided by 2 and 10 can be divide by 5</li>
  <li>So we get 1/1 * 2/4 = 2/4</li>
  <li>Now like we know 2 and 4 are divisable by each - other,so we get 1/2</li>
</ul>

<h5>Dividation</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Suppose we have an expression x/y &divide; a/b so, we will reciprocal the term by which number is divide(a/b) and the divide will be changed to multiply.</li>
  <li>It means that the x/y &divide; a/b will be converted to x/y * b/a</li>
</ul>
